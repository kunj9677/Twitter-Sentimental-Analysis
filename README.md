# Twitter-Tweet-Analysis
I have made a twitter tweets analysis project using Python and its library.

This will ask the user to enter the key word and the number of tweeets on which he/she wants the analysis.

This will show the output of the tweets analysis on peoples sentiments catagorise into 7 different sentiments.

Images of the output of the code:-
